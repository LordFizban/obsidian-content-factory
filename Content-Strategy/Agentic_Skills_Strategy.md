# Agentic Skills Strategy: Automation with Obsidian

This document outlines the strategy for implementing "Agentic Skills" to transform this Obsidian Vault into a semi-autonomous Content Management System (CMS).

## 🧠 The Philosophy

We will treat "Skills" as specialized team members (Agents) that you or I can summon to perform complex content tasks. Each skill is defined by a specific **Persona**, a **Procedure**, and **Outputs**.

## 👥 The Agentic Team

### 1. The Content Strategist (Social Media Expertise)
* **Goal:** Maximize engagement and reach for every designated topic.
* **Input:** A draft article or a raw idea.

### 2. The Master Agile Coach (The Sparring Partner)
* **Goal:** Act as the "Senior Coach" you describe in your articles—providing wisdom, tough love, and frameworks.
* **Input:** A problem statement, a retro plan, or a draft concept.

### 3. The Localization Lead (Turkish/English)
* **Goal:** Expand your reach to the local market without losing your voice.
* **Input:** A finished English article.

### 4. The Creative Director (Video & Visuals)
* **Goal:** Streamline the transition from "Text" to "Video".
* **Input:** A finished article.

### 5. The Editor-in-Chief (Content Writing & QA)
* **Goal:** Ensure every piece of content meets the "Agile Coach" standard before publishing.
* **Input:** Draft content.

### 6. The Vault Manager (CMS & Analytics)
* **Goal:** Keep the "Digital Factory" clean and measure success.
* **Input:** The entire Vault state.
