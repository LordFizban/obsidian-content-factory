## 📅 January 2026 Review

**Date:** February 7, 2026
**Period:** Weeks 1-5 (plus Week 6 start)

### 1. High-Level Scorecard

| Metric | Target (Strategy) | Actual (Jan) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cadence (Articles)** | ~0.7 / month | **2** (AI Sparring, AI Discovery) | 🚀 **High Velocity** (200%) |
| **Cadence (Carousels)** | 1-2 / month | **2** (AI Sparring, AI Discovery) | ✅ **On Target** |
| **Audience Quality** | "Right Room" | **50%** External Senior | 🟢 **Healthy** |
| **Schedule** | Tue (Primary) + Thu | **Tue + Thu** | ✅ **Validated** (Thu adds ~30% imp) |

### 2. Pillar Balance Check

| Pillar | Target | Actual (Items) | Actual (%) | Drift Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI in Scrum** | 25% | 3 | **50%** | ⚠️ **Over-indexed.** We are leaning hard into the "Hot Topic". |
| **Manager Partnership** | 35% | 1 | **17%** | 🔴 **Gap.** Our "Key Differentiator" is neglected. |
| **Psychological Safety** | 25% | 1 | **17%** | 🟡 Slightly under. |
| **Metrics That Matter** | 15% | 1 | **17%** | ✅ On Target. |

> **Insight:** We are chasing the "AI Hype" successfully (highest engagement), but neglecting our core differentiator (Manager Partnership).

### 3. Key Learnings

1. **AI Breeds Strangers:** AI content has a 4x higher "True External" reach rate (50% vs 12.5%). It is our primary growth engine.
2. **Carousels = High Signal / Low Volume:**
    - *AI Sparring (Jan 20):* 272 imp, but **100% High-Value Engagement** (Matt Snell, Danish Soomro).
    - *AI Discovery (Feb 5):* 104 imp (Flop).
    - *Action:* Treat Carousels as "Expert Signals" for your niche, not growth engines. Don't force them weekly. Use Thursday for "Short Video" or "Text Repost" if you want broader reach.
3. **Thursday is Viable:** Week 4 and Week 6 proved the 2-post schedule works.

### 4. February Correction Plan

1. **Pivot to Manager Partnership:** Next "Big Rock" article must be about Managers/Leadership to correct the drift.
2. **Stabilize Cadence:** We sprinted hard in Jan. It's okay to slow down to 1 Article/Month to avoid burnout.
3. **Fix Thursday:** Experiment with "Short Video" or "Mini-Post" instead of heavy Carousel production on Thursdays.

## 📅 February 2026 Review

**Date:** February 28, 2026
**Period:** Weeks 7–9 (Feb 9 – Feb 28, 2026)
**Skills Applied:** Content Strategist • Agile Coach • Marketing Psychologist • Social Content Expert

### 1. High-Level Scorecard

| Metric | Target | Jan Actual | Feb Actual | Grade |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Cadence (Articles)** | ~0.7/month | 2 articles | 1 article | A |
| **Cadence (Posting)** | Tue + Thu | Validated W4 | Standard W6-W9 | A |
| **Weekly Impressions** | 800+ baseline | Best: 727 (W4) | Best: 896 (W9) 🏆 | A |
| **Audience Quality** | Senior+Dir >50% | 54.2% | 54.0% | A |
| **Follower Growth** | +20% YoY | +3 (Jan) | +3 (Feb) | C |
| **Pillar Balance** | 25/35/25/15 | AI 50% / MP 17% | AI 47% / MP 29% | B- |

### 2. Pillar Balance Check (Cumulative: 17 Items)

| Pillar | Target | Total | Actual % | Δ vs Jan | Status |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **AI in Scrum** | 25% | 8 | 47% | -3pp | 🔴 Still over-indexed |
| **Manager Partnership** | 35% | 5 | 29% | +12pp | 🟡 Closing the gap |
| **Psychological Safety** | 25% | 4 | 24% | +7pp | ✅ On target |
| **Metrics That Matter** | 15% | 1 | 6% | -11pp | 🔴 Neglected |

> **Agile Coach Verdict:** The Manager Pivot delivered — February's correction was executed. But Metrics That Matter starved at 6%. The AI pillar hit its WIP limit at 8 items. **March must deliver 2 Metrics That Matter posts and zero new AI-original content.**

### 3. Key Learnings

1. **The Volume Trap (Confirmed):** 4 posts in W8 yielded 828 impressions vs 896 for 2 posts in W9. Two high-quality posts is the global optimum — not just a local one.
2. **Authority Borrowing = Only Follower Conversion Mechanism:** Followers ONLY grew in weeks with external voice tagging (Scrum.org, Fred Deichler, Danish Soomro). Pure own-voice weeks = zero growth.
3. **The Fred Deichler Breakthrough:** A practitioner with 5,120 followers mentioned us by name — 25 comments from industry leaders. This is the "Sprint Review moment" — showing artifacts, not promoting.
4. **Manager Partnership is Lower-Engagement:** Both W9 manager posts got 2 reactions, 0 comments each. The AI pillar consistently generates more engagement. Consider: does MP content need stronger CTAs? Or is this the natural ceiling?
5. **Articles > Text Posts on Reach:** Manager's Manual (article) got 357 impressions vs Business Owner Story (text) at 225. But neither converted comments.

### 4. March Correction Plan

1. **Freeze AI Pillar:** No new AI-original posts. Reposts only if high-authority voice appears.
2. **Feed Metrics That Matter:** 2 dedicated MTM posts (Time-to-Clarity story, cycle time/blocker metric).
3. **Continue Manager Partnership:** 3 more MP posts to push toward 35% target.
4. **Alternate Authority Borrowing:** Repost/comment on a thought leader post every other week to sustain follower conversion.
5. **Test stronger CTAs:** Add explicit engagement questions to Manager Partnership posts.

### 5. Strategy Revisions

| Element | Action | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|
| AI pillar | **Freeze at 8 items through Q1** | WIP Limit — let other pillars catch up |
| Metrics That Matter | **Add 2 posts in March** | Most neglected pillar at 6% |
| Follower strategy | **Active Authority Borrowing every other week** | Only proven conversion mechanism |
| CTA design | **Test explicit questions on MP posts** | MP content generates 0 comments |
| Volume | **Never exceed 2 posts/week** | Confirmed across 2 experiments |
