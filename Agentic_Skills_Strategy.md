# Agentic Skills Strategy: Content Factory

This document tracks the deployment and lifecycle of agentic skills (digital employees) within the Content Factory. It outlines our 7-Phase strategy for expanding from a core team to a fully automated multi-platform production engine.

## 🏛️ Architecture: The 3-Layer Model

Our skills are organized into three functional layers:

1. Strategic Layer (Intelligence) — Goal setting, pillar development, and high-level design.
2. Production Layer (Execution) — Writing, localizing, and formatting content.
3. Operations Layer (Automation) — File management, publishing, and analytics.

- **Community Sync:** Every quarter, compare local versions against [antigravity-awesome-skills](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills).
- **Customization:** Core Team skills (1-6) are customized for brand voice and should only be updated manually.
- **Verification:** All new skill deployments must be verified with ls -R .agent/skills and confirmed valid metadata.
